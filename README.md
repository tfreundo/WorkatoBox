# WorkatoBox
WorkatoBox is a minimalistic tool that improves your productivity using the principles of Pomodoro.

## How it works
After the setup is done all LEDs will light up 5 times, afterwards the WorkatoBox is waiting for user input.

There are 3 Push-Buttons that have the following functionality:
1. Left Button: Starts a work period of 25min. The blue LED will be ON while this time period and OFF after the time period is over.
1. Middle Button: Starts a pause period of 5min (small pause). The green LED will be ON while this time period and OFF after the time period is over.
1. Right Button: Starts a pause period of 10min (big pause). The green LED will be ON while this time period and OFF after the time period is over.

You can interrupt a work or pause period while it's running by pushing any of the three Push-Buttons.
